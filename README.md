# Playing around with iterators and generators in javascript

> Great thanks to [Fun Fun Function chanel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) on YouTube!
> for an excellent explanation of basic principles and examples of how and why these things work!

To run these examples locally, please follow the steps below:

```sh
npm install

npm start
```

Then results will be shown in the console. Please note, that async user generator works almost for an infinity period, so if you are done, just press in the console:

```sh
CTRL + C
```
